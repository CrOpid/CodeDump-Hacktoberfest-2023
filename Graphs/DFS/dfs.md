## A DFS traversal for a grpah is similar to a DFS traversal of a tree, unlike it can contain cycles that would make us to traverse the graph infinitely.

## To prevent this never ending traversal, we will utilize a 'visited' array.

## Once we visit a node we'll add that node into answer vector, and at the same will mark its visited condition in the visited array as true.

## So that will make sure visit only unvisited nodes, checking the condition that it has not been visited previously.'''
